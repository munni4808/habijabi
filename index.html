						<p>The N1 or Dhaka–Chittagong Highway is a main transportation artery in Bangladesh, between Dhaka and Chittagong. Approximately 250 kilometres (160 miles) in length, the road links the country's two largest cities, Dhaka and Chittagong.The highway is known along various stretches as the Chittagong–Cox's Bazar Highway and the Cox's Bazar–Teknaf Highway. Currently two lanes with a four-lane expansion underway, the N1 is the busiest road in the country and a top development priority.Construction of a larger Dhaka-Chittagong expressway has been proposed to decrease traffic on the highway.In January 2010, expansion of the highway from two lanes to four lanes started.The project will decrease the travel time from Dhaka to Chittagong to 4.5 or 5 hours.As of March 2013, only 23.5 per cent of work has been completed, and it was unlikely to meet its December 2013 deadline. Construction included 221 culverts, 22 bridges and three flyovers.Reza Construction Ltd.</p>

						<p>The Dhaka-Mawa-Bhanga Expressway is the only national expressway in Bangladesh. It is operated by Road Transport and Highways Division. It is a part of the Asian Highway Network.This six-lanes expressway has two service lanes, five flyovers, 19 underpasses, two interchanges, four railway over-bridges, four large bridges, 25 small bridges and 54 culverts. After finishing construction of Padma Bridge, the two side of expressway will be connected through it.The length of the highway is 31.7 km from Jatrabari to Mawa, 3.0 km from Babu Bazar to Ekuria, and 20km from Panchor to Bhanga. The Bangladesh Army's 24 Engineering Construction Brigade has been implementing both the main and supporting projects. The expressway was opened for traffic on March 11, 2020.Tenure of the supporting project ended in June 2020. Financial progress of the project was recorded 73 per cent, while physical progress was over 90 per cent.</p>

						<h3 style="color:green">Expressway Highway</h3>
						<p>Expressway,also called throughway, thruway, parkway, freeway, superhighway, or motorway, major arterial divided highway that features two or more traffic lanes in each direction, with opposing traffic separated by a median strip; elimination of grade crossings; controlled entries and exits; and advanced designs eliminating steep grades, sharp curves, and other hazards and inconveniences to driving. Frequently expressways have been constructed over completely new routes, passing near but not through large centres of population, on more or less direct lines between desired termini. Their advantages include high speed, greater safety, comfort and convenience for drivers and passengers, and lower vehicle operating costs. Many of these new express highways, especially in the United States, are toll roads, but that is an incidental, not an essential, feature.</p>
