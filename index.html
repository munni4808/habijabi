<h1>Dhaka Chittagong Elevated Express Way</h1>
<p>Expressway, also called throughway, thruway, parkway, freeway, superhighway, or motorway, major arterial divided highway that features two or more traffic lanes in each direction, with opposing traffic separated by a median strip; elimination of grade crossings; controlled entries and exits; and advanced designs eliminating steep grades, sharp curves, and other hazards and inconveniences to driving. Frequently expressways have been constructed over completely new routes, passing near but not through large centres of population, on more or less direct lines between desired termini. Their advantages include high speed, greater safety, comfort and convenience for drivers and passengers, and lower vehicle operating costs. Many of these new express highways, especially in the United States, are toll roads, but that is an incidental, not an essential, feature.

			<p> If the elevated expressway is built with rail tracks, one will be able to travel from one important city to another within an hour by a highspeed train while it will take two hours by buses.Besides, the chief engineer said as per their plan there will be the option for operating both buses and trains on the elevated expressway. "It'll not only ease traffic jams and ensure smooth road communication, but also save huge agricultural land, bazaars, mosques, educational institutions and establishments from destruction."</p>

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>Chittagong Elevated Expressway is the second elevated expressway project in Bangladesh. It will be constructed from Lalkhan Bazar in Chittagong city to the airport or Patenga beach. The city will be directly connected to South Chittagong through the Elevated Expressway with the Karnafuli Tunnel. The N1 or Dhaka–Chittagong Highway is a main transportation artery in Bangladesh, between Dhaka and Chittagong.huge goods can be transported through freight trains from 10pm to 5am through the elevated expressway as there will be no passengers' flow at that time.
According to an ABD study conducted in 2013, 90 percent of Bangladesh's goods for export and import are transported through the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway.With a total length of 46.73km, including 19.73km mainline, the expressway aimed to provide a release valve for the escalating pressure on the streets below.</p>

<h1>Mega project to be launched</h1>
<p>In 2013, datelines were shifted and project cost revised upwards to Tk 8,920.2 crore. The new deadline was 2021, but for the pandemic, it was pushed to the end of 2022, making it the most protracted project of the government.Even that seems far-fetched seeing that only 30 per cent of the 20-km expressway, stretching from the Hazrat Shahjalal International airport to Kutubkhal point on the Chittagong road, has been completed so far.huge goods can be transported through freight trains from 10pm to 5am through the elevated expressway as there will be no passengers' flow at that time.

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The decision was finalised as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the authorities concerned to go for the elevated expressway option considering its facilities, future benefits and judicious use of land, according to sources at Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA).The Roads and Highways Department (RHD) earlier took a plan for constructing a 218-km at-grade six-lane expressway in addition to the existing Dhaka-Chittagong national highway to ease traffic congestion.Though the existing highway has been upgraded to a 4-lane one, it still takes 6 to 7 hours to go to Chittagong or vice versa by a bus. So, after constructing another expressway through land, it won't help that much cut the travel time as vehicles won't be able to move with over 100km speed an hour uninterruptedly on it for various factors</p>

			<p>Dhaka–Chittagong Highway is a main transportation artery in Bangladesh, between Dhaka and Chittagong. Approximately 250 kilometres (160 miles) in length, the road links the country's two largest cities, Dhaka and Chittagong.The highway is known along various stretches as the Chittagong–Cox's Bazar Highway and the Cox's Bazar–Teknaf Highway. Currently two lanes with a four-lane expansion underway, the N1 is the busiest road in the country and a top development priority.Construction of a larger Dhaka-Chittagong expressway has been proposed to decrease traffic on the highway</p>
